  summary: `
    I’m Allen Chun, currently based in Singapore as a Senior Manager / Full Stack Software Engineer at Singapore Tourism Board.

    With my over 13 years of experience building scalable web applications and leading high-impact projects.

    My expertise spans Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, Vue.js, and Node.js, with deep 
    experience in cloud-native architectures on AWS. I’ve designed and delivered 
    production-grade, government-compliant systems for the Singapore Tourism Board, 
    where I currently serve as Senior Manager / Full Stack Developer.

    Over the years, I’ve built everything from large-scale content platforms and 
    visitor-facing kiosks to mobile travel apps, secure APIs for inter-agency data 
    exchange, and crisis management systems. My work consistently focuses on 
    improving efficiency, enabling self-service experiences, and ensuring robust 
    security and performance at scale.

    I’m also passionate about AI and LLM integration, exploring solutions with OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, and AWS Bedrock Agents to push the boundaries of how software can empower organizations and users.

    When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me exploring new tech stacks, mentoring 
    teams on clean, scalable practices, or spending time with my family while dreaming up  the next big idea.
